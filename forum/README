Forum configuration: common.csv contains details regarding the sql connection string, specifically the keys phpbb_sql_user, phpbb_sql_pw. The database and config.php file are automatically configured by puppet.

The actual phpbb installation process is utterly impossible to script (unless you want to fire POST requests out of your eyes). So instead, in this dir 'forum_init_config.mysql' contains the initial database that phpbb creates when you configure it. To install it, as root,

mysql new_dbname < forum_init_config.mysql

The admin username is 'admin', password 123456. To change this in the sql dump, see the "INSERT INTO `phpbb_users` line. The password can be various formats, but a hex md5sum is valid.
