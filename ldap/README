This file contains a dummy school/college/teacher/student configuration, generated by Sam for testing Nemesis. It's also useful for the IDE.

To import it into ldap:

ldapadd -x -f filename.ldif -D managerdn -W

Usernames/Passwords:

teacher_coll1/facebees
teacher_coll2/noway
student_coll1_1/cows

If you want to modify and reapply the ldap backup do these things:


* service slapd stop
* rm /usr/local/var/sr/ldap_installed
* sudo rm -rf /var/lib/ldap/studentrobotics.org/*
* service slapd start
* puppet apply /etc/puppet/manifests/sr-dev.pp
